# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. There are three different game modes available: Player vs Player, Player vs CPU, and CPU vs CPU.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Tic Tac Toe game, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/JZMegaRayquaza/TicTacToe.git
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:** 
    ```
    pip install pygame
    ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
2. Run one of the Python files based on the game mode you want to play:
   - For Player vs Player: 
     ```
     python tic_tac_toe.py
     ```
   - For Player vs CPU: 
     ```
     python tic_tac_toe_cpu.py
     ```
   - For CPU vs CPU: 
     ```
     python tic_tac_toe_cpu_cpu.py
     ```

## How to Play

The rules of Tic Tac Toe are simple:
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their symbol (either "X" or "O") in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
